We are following the TSLint and Editorconfig rules listed at their config files. We strongly recommend to use a code editor with good support for these tools (we recommend VSCode), so that it is easy to integrate new code into our code base.\nFirst Run\nAfter cloning the project and installing the dependencies with npm install you should be able start coding.\nYou can double check if the local environment is fully working by running the tests with npm test and building the project with npm run build.\nMain Development Commands\nExecute unit tests and check coverage:\n\nnpm test\n\nExecute unit tests in watch mode for TDD purposes:\n\nnpm run tdd\n\nLint Typescript code:\n\nnpm run lint\n\nCommit convention helper (see related topic below):\n\nnpm run commit\n\nGenerate API reference documentation locally:\n\nnpm run docs\n\nBuild the project locally:\n\nnpm run build\n\nCommit Message Format\nThis repository follows a strict Commit Message Conventions, which leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. Also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log, calculate the new version number and automatically publish new versions to NPM. For these purposes, we are using Semantic Release. We have a helper script npm run commit that provides a command line based wizard for easy commit message formatting.\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nOnly the first line is mandatory, and any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! A linter will check your commit message in a git hook for each commit and guide you to fix any error. Please take a look at the AngularJS Commit Message Conventions for detailed information about this convention.\nSubmitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch our repository for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n\nFork the project on Github\n\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n  git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, following code style guidelines, and including appropriate test cases.\n\nRun the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.\n\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message format:\n   npm run commit\nPush your branch to your GitHub fork:\n  git push origin my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to ng-jexia:master.\n\nCheck if our Continuous Integration checks passed against your PR and make the necessary fixes if something breaks.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nPlease apply the required updates.\n\nRe-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n\nRe-run performance tests to make sure your changes didn't hurt performance.\n\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it!
